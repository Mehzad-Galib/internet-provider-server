This is the server or backend side of Raj Net BD page, where information provided from client side is stored in the database. MongoDB is used for this backend project. If someone places order, or write a review, or adds a service or wants to give someone admin access, the data will be stored by creating api in the backend, and then stored on the mongoDB server.
